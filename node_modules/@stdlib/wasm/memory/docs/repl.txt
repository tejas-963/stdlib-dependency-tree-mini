{{alias}}( descriptor )
    WebAssembly memory constructor.

    Parameters
    ----------
    descriptor: Object
        Memory descriptor object.

    descriptor.initial: integer
        Initial memory size in units of WebAssembly pages (i.e., 64KiB).

    descriptor.maximum: integer (optional)
        Maximum memory size in units of WebAssembly pages (i.e., 64KiB).

    descriptor.shared: boolean (optional)
        Boolean indicating whether the memory is shared. Default: false.

    Returns
    -------
    out: Memory
        WebAssembly memory instance.

    Examples
    --------
    > var mem = new {{alias}}( { 'initial': 0 } )
    <Memory>


{{alias}}.prototype.buffer
    Read-only property which returns the ArrayBuffer (or SharedArrayBuffer)
    referenced by the memory instance.

    Examples
    --------
    > var mem = new {{alias}}( { 'initial': 0 } );
    > mem.buffer
    <ArrayBuffer>


{{alias}}.prototype.grow( delta )
    Increases the size of the memory instance by a specified number of
    WebAssembly pages (i.e., 64KiB).

    Upon increasing the size, the previous ArrayBuffer is detached, thus
    invalidating any typed arrays which were views over the previous
    ArrayBuffer.

    Detachment means that the previous ArrayBuffer byte length becomes zero, and
    it no longer has bytes accessible to JavaScript.

    ArrayBuffer detachment applies even when `delta` is zero.

    Detachment only applies for non-shared memory instances. For a shared memory
    instance, the initial buffer (which is a SharedArrayBuffer) will not become
    detached and, instead, its length will not be updated.

    Accesses to the `buffer` property after growing a SharedArrayBuffer will
    yield a larger SharedArrayBuffer which may access a larger span of memory
    than the buffer before growing memory.

    Every SharedArrayBuffer accessed via the `buffer` property will always refer
    to the start of the same memory address range and thus manipulate the same
    data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    delta: integer
        Number of WebAssembly pages (i.e., 64KiB) by which to grow the
        underlying memory.

    Returns
    -------
    out: integer
        Size of the previous memory (in units of pages).

    Examples
    --------
    > var mem = new {{alias}}( { 'initial': 0 } );
    > mem.grow( 1 )
    <number>
