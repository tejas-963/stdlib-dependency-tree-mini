{{alias}}( ctx, arrays )
    Converts a list of arrays to "pointers" (i.e., byte offsets) in WebAssembly
    module memory.

    Beware that this function may reallocate module memory, resulting in
    ArrayBuffer detachment and the invalidation of any typed array views which
    were views of the previously allocated memory.

    Additionally, this function may write to module memory and does so without
    regard for any existing memory content. Users are thus encouraged to take
    suitable precautions (e.g., copying results out of module memory prior to
    subsequent invocation) in order to avoid unexpected results.

    Each element in the list of input arrays should have the following
    properties:

    - dtype: array data type.
    - wdtype: WebAssembly array data type.
    - length: number of indexed elements.
    - data: original array-like object.
    - stride: index increment.
    - offset: index offset.

    In addition to each element's existing properties, each element of the
    returned array has the following additional properties:

    - BYTES_PER_ELEMENT: number of bytes per element.
    - ptr: byte offset.
    - nbytes: number of bytes consumed by indexed array elements as stored in
      module memory.
    - copy: boolean indicating whether an array had to be copied to module
      memory.

    If an array's data is copied to module memory, the data is copied to a
    contiguous segment of module memory, and the respective array object in the
    returned array will have unit stride and an offset of zero.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ctx: Object
        Module context.

    ctx.isView: Function
        Function which returns a boolean indicating if a provided array is a
        view of module memory.

    ctx.realloc: Function
        Function which reallocates module memory.

    ctx.view: DataView
        Accessor property which returns a DataView of the current module memory.

    arrays: Array<Object>
        List of array objects.

    Returns
    -------
    out: Array<Object>
        Array objects containing pointers to array locations in module memory.
